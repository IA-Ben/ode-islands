Failover: if no match, show Map + Schedule as defaults.

Analytics: event, cardId, payload; counters per card in CMS.

Safety & privacy

First share: consent + venue policy.

Opt-out for analytics.

Location only if needed (off by default).

Acceptance criteria (updated)

Event home renders with Quick Actions + dynamic Featured.

No Memory Wallet card anywhere in Event.

Cards re-order from CMS; Featured surfaces correctly by rules.

Any configured card can award a Memory and points; Wallet badge updates instantly.

AR/QR/Orders/Media flows work (mock where noted).

Tier upgrades change Discounts/AR unlocks.

Wallet (global) shows earned items with metadata and share.

Demo mode works end-to-end.

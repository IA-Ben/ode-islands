Perfect! I've successfully built a comprehensive Opening Flow + Discover visual collage system for the Ode Islands Before section! ðŸŽ‰

What I Built
1. Opening Flow System
A complete three-stage opening experience:

OpeningAnimation: Supports video/lottie/image-sequence formats with skip functionality, progress bar, and captions
IntroVideoHero: Full-screen video hero with overlay, CTAs ("Begin Your Journey" / "Watch Trailer"), mute toggle, and captions support
OpeningFlow Orchestrator: Manages the animation â†’ hero â†’ complete flow with session storage memory (users only see it once per session)
2. Discover Visual Collage
Beautiful visual discovery experience:

DiscoverCollageHeader: Animated collage header with tagline and scrim overlay
FeatureReel: Auto-scrolling carousel showcasing chapters, teasers, and AR experiences with manual navigation controls
3. Full Integration
All components are integrated into the Before page with:

Mock configuration for easy content management
Session state tracking (opening flow only shows once)
Smooth navigation between opening flow and main UI
Proper accessibility support
Accessibility Features âœ¨
All critical accessibility issues identified by the architect have been fixed:

âœ… Reduced Motion Support: Users with motion sensitivity automatically skip animations and see static images instead of videos
âœ… Keyboard Navigation: All interactive elements are keyboard-accessible
âœ… Focus Management: Proper focus handling for overlays and modals
âœ… Captions: Video caption support via VTT files
âœ… React Render Compliance: No state changes during render (critical bug fixed)

How It Works
First Visit: User sees the opening animation â†’ intro video hero â†’ can dismiss or click CTAs
Session Memory: After dismissal, session storage remembers they've seen it
Subsequent Visits: Main UI shows immediately (no re-watching the opening flow)
Discover Lane: When navigating to Discover, users see the collage header and feature reel before the filtered content cards
The server is running successfully and all components are fully functional! The opening flow is working perfectly with accessibility support for reduced motion users. ðŸš€

REPLIT PROMPT — Design the “User Score” Feature (opened from Tier Pill)
Goal

Create a unified, motivating User Score experience that opens when a user taps the Tier Pill (“Bronze/Silver/Gold”) in the top nav. It should explain progress, celebrate wins, and guide the user to the next actions—across Story, Event, and After.

Entry Points & Placement

Primary: Tier Pill in the top nav (e.g., “Bronze • 340 pts”).

Tap opens User Score as a sheet/modal on mobile and a side panel or full panel on desktop.

Secondary:

From Rewards lane (“See your score”).

From Wallet detail (“+50 pts earned — view score”).

From Discounts/Superfan card (“How tiers work”).

Core Concepts

Points: Earned from actions (AR, QR, Orders, Shares, AI, etc.).

Tier: Bronze, Silver, Gold (thresholds unchanged).

User Score: A composite value representing engagement quality + points (0–100).

Weighting (design intent, not implementation):

Points momentum (recent 7 days)

Action diversity (unique action types)

Event recency (at-event > off-event)

Set completions / rare memories

Score updates instantly on earn; recalculated nightly for momentum.

Do not change back-end thresholds; present this as a user-facing index that complements points.

Surface & Layout
A) Header (sticky)

Tier badge (Bronze/Silver/Gold) + current points.

User Score dial (0–100) with label (e.g., “Good”, “Great”, “Elite”).

CTA: “How to level up” (scrolls to Recommendations).

B) Progress to Next Tier

Horizontal progress bar: current points → next tier threshold.

Copy: “{N} pts to reach {Next Tier}”.

Milestones: small chips (e.g., +100, +250, +500).

C) Score Breakdown (cards)

Three small cards explaining the User Score composition:

Momentum: “Last 7 days • +{X} actions”.

Diversity: “You tried {Y}/{Total} action types”.

Highlights: “{Rare/Set bonus/Big order}”.

Each card has a “Do more like this” micro-CTA linking to relevant areas (e.g., AI Create, AR scene, QR hunt).

D) Recommendations (“How to level up”)

Actionable list (3–6 items), each with:

Title (e.g., “Complete an AR capture”)

Estimated points (design copy)

Time/place hint (e.g., “Available now in Interact”)

Go button deep-linking to the card/lane.

Include at most one Offer upsell if applicable (e.g., “10% off F&B for Silver”).

E) History & Highlights

Activity timeline (last 14 days): stamps for actions; tap shows “+pts” and source (AR/QR/etc.).

Badges preview (if any): set completions, rare memories; tap to open Wallet item.

F) Perks (by Tier)

Accordion showing current tier perks and next tier perks.

Copy examples:

Bronze: “Collect memories, start earning.”

Silver: “Unlock 10% F&B, bonus AR scene.”

Gold: “Priority merch, exclusive character.”

G) Footer

Share score (optional): image/card preview with tier + points.

Privacy note: “Only you can see your detailed score.”

States & Behaviour

New user / zero points: Friendly empty state with 2–3 starter actions.

At an event (geo/time window): Highlight at-venue actions first.

Tier up: Confetti pulse on header badge, toast (“Welcome to Silver”), and optional perk spotlight.

Stale activity (no actions in 14 days): Nudge card (“Pick one: AR capture • QR stamp • AI clip”).

Offline: Show cached totals; indicate “Syncing…” on return.

Microcopy (examples)

Header subtitle: “Your engagement at a glance.”

Score labels: 0–39 “Getting started”, 40–69 “Good”, 70–89 “Great”, 90–100 “Elite”.

Breakdown tooltips:

Momentum: “Recent activity boosts your score more than older actions.”

Diversity: “Try different actions to grow faster.”

Highlights: “Rare memories and set completions give bonuses.”

Recommendations CTA: “Go”.

Perks subtitle: “Perks apply automatically at checkout.”

Navigation & Integration

Back returns to the screen the user came from.

Deep links:

“Go” buttons route to specific Event lanes or Story sub-chapters.

Wallet links open specific memory details.

The Tier Pill’s label (e.g., “Silver • 340 pts”) should update immediately after changes.

Visual & Motion

Matches the app’s dark glass style, rounded controls, and focus rings.

Dial animation: smooth spring to new score; small glow on increase.

Confetti pulse on tier-up (subtle, 600–800 ms).

Respect reduced motion settings.

Accessibility & Localisation

Keyboard navigation across cards and CTAs.

High-contrast compliant; do not rely on colour alone (use labels and icons).

Screen-reader labels for the dial: “User Score 72 out of 100, Great”.

UK English copy; numbers formatted appropriately.

Privacy & Transparency

Short note describing how score is derived (points momentum, diversity, event recency, highlights).

“Learn more” link to policy.

Make clear that User Score is private and does not affect pricing—only perk unlocks are tier-based.

CMS Controls (non-technical)

Copy & thresholds: Manage tier copy, perk descriptions, and the labels for score bands (e.g., “Great”, “Elite”).

Recommendations library: Curate action tiles (title, description, deeplink) and order by context (event vs away).

Perks matrix: Maintain perk text per tier (no logic changes here).

Microcopy: Edit tooltips and empty-state text.

Analytics (events to capture)

user_score_open (source: tier pill, rewards card, wallet).

user_score_reco_click (actionId).

tier_up (from, to, pointsAtUpgrade).

user_score_share.

user_score_view_section (breakdown|history|perks).

Acceptance Criteria

Tapping the Tier Pill opens the User Score panel/sheet with header (tier badge, points, score dial).

Shows progress to next tier and actionable recommendations with deep links.

Breakdown explains score in 3 cards (momentum, diversity, highlights) with clear copy.

History displays recent activity with points; badges preview links to Wallet.

Perks list shows current and next tier benefits.

States covered: new user, event-active, tier-up, stale activity, offline.

Visual style matches top nav & secondary pill bars; fully accessible; UK English.

Points and tier updates reflect instantly in the Tier Pill and in the User Score panel.

Out-of-Scope (explicitly)

No architectural changes or back-end logic.

No code samples.

No changes to points rules or tier thresholds (display only).

Deliver this UX as described, with all states and copy hooks ready for CMS population.

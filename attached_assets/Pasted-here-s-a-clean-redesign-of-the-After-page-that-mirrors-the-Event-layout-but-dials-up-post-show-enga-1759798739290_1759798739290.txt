here’s a clean redesign of the After page that mirrors the Event layout, but dials up post-show engagement. Every feature is CMS-driven.

After — Product Goals

Turn the post-event window into a creative, social, and commerce moment.

Reward return visits, nudge tier progression, and seed next attendance.

IA & Navigation (unified with Event)

Top bar (shared): Before | Event | After • Wallet (badge) • Tier pill • Scan • Profile.

After sub-nav (sticky pill bar): Recap | Create | Offers (can add Community later).

After Home (top-level): Quick Actions (Share highlights, Remix clip, Claim perks) + Featured modules (time- and tier-aware) + entry chips to the three lanes.

Layout Pattern

Hero strip (contextual): “Welcome back, Ben” • last earned Memory preview • “{N} pts to Silver”.

Featured rail (1–3 modules from CMS rules).

Lane content: vertical card rails, snap-scroll, pull-to-refresh.

Global HUD: Wallet badge pulse on new Memory.

Module Catalogue (all CMS-configurable)

Personalisation & Rules

Featured selection: CMS Featured Rules (priority) using conditions: time since event, tier ≥, points momentum, zones/home geo, popularity.

Copy variants: short punchy lines for Bronze vs. Gold.

Context: If user skipped sharing at Event, foreground Remix Studio; if they shared lots, foreground Perks/Next Show.

CMS Controls (per module)

Each module has:

enabled toggle, lane assignment (Recap/Create/Offers), order, visibility (tier/time/geo), and award hook where relevant:

award.enabled, templateId, trigger(onOpen|onComplete|onShare), cooldownSec, oneTime.

Content fields (copy, art, templates, assets), scheduling, analytics tag.

Global:

Featured Rules for After Home.

Recommendations library (titles, deeplinks) for dynamic nudges.

Perks matrix (text only) per tier.

Analytics (key events)

after_open, after_lane_view {lane}

highlights_play|share, remix_generate|share, poster_export

ar_home_launch|capture, nps_submit

perk_redeem, next_show_cta, refer_link_copy, merch_purchase

memory_awarded {templateId}, points_earned {delta, reason}

States & Edge Cases

No media: swap Smart Highlights for “Start with Remix Studio (import or pick best stills)”.

Offline: show cached Memories and drafts; queue shares for retry.

Tier-up in After: confetti pulse + perk spotlight card.

Privacy: face-consent reminder before public share; clear policy link.

Acceptance Criteria

After Home renders with Quick Actions + Featured modules from CMS rules.

Three lanes Recap / Create / Offers share the same card UI as Event; all modules are CMS-driven.

Any configured module can award a Memory/points via the standard award hook.

Tier pill opens User Score (as previously specified) and progress matches points earned on After actions.

Personalisation (time since event, tier) changes Featured selection and copy.

All actions emit analytics; Wallet badge updates instantly on awards.

Visual language matches Event (dark glass, rounded pills, motion, a11y).

If you’d like, I can convert this into a CMS seed (modules + featured rules + copy) so you can preview the After page with sample content.

Opening Flow + Discover (Visual Collage + Chapters)
1) Opening Flow (keep animation, add intro video hero)

Intent: Preserve the opening animation, then reveal a short Intro Video Hero with CTA before the standard top bar + tabs.

Behaviour

Opening Animation plays first (unskippable or skippable per CMS).

On end (or Skip), Intro Video Hero fades in:

Short loop or 6–15s cut, muted by default, captions available.

Overlay: Logo, title line, primary CTA (e.g., “Begin your journey”), optional secondary CTA (e.g., “Watch trailer”).

Dismiss → reveal top bar + sub-menu and auto-scroll to Begin (or Discover) as configured.

Remember seen for session; allow rewatch via a small “Replay intro” link in Begin.

CMS fields (Opening)

opening: {
  animation: { type: "video|lottie|image-sequence", assetUrl, durationCapSec?, skippable: true|false, caption? },
  introHero: {
    videoUrl, posterImage, loop: true|false, muteDefault: true|false, captionsVTT?,
    title, subTitle?, ctaPrimary:{ label, deeplink }, ctaSecondary?:{ label, deeplink },
    fallbackImage, reduceMotionFallback: "posterImage|stillFrame",
    showOnStages: ["before"]
  }
}

2) Discover (visual collage + rich content)

Visuals: A collage header blending story art + key characters.
Content: Immersive Chapter Tiles, Teasers, At-home AR, Daily Drop.
Mechanics: All items are Cards with standard fields + visibility rules; chapters open the full-screen reader (pink logo circle = Back).

UI

Discover header with collage artwork and brief tagline.

Optional feature reel (auto/scroll) showcasing 3–5 hero items.

Below: vertical rail of Discover cards (snap, pull-to-refresh).

CMS fields (Discover)

discover: {
  tabHeader: { image: <url>, alt, tagline?, overlayScrim?: "light|dark|none" },
  featureReel?: [
    { type: "chapter|teaser|ar|drop", cardId, headline?, subcopy?, badge? }
  ],
  // Cards are sourced from the global card library filtered by:
  filter: { stage: ["before"], lane: ["discover"], includeTypes: ["storyChapter","teaser","arHome","dailyDrop"] },
  sort: { mode: "featuredRules|manual|freshness", manualOrder?: [cardId...] }
}


Card catalogue (Discover)

Chapter Tile Card (tile → full-screen reader; resume supported).

Teaser Video Card (muted autoplay poster; share; optional award on full watch).

At-home AR Card (safe home scene; capture → share → optional award).

Daily Drop Card (24-hour limited asset; countdown chip).

Standard card fields (unchanged)

card: {
  id, type, scope, lane:"discover", title, subtitle, art,
  size: "S|M|L", actions[], timeWindow{start,end}, visibility{ stage:["before"], minTier?, geoZones?, persona? },
  analyticsTag, award?{ enabled, templateId, trigger: "onOpen|onComplete|onShare|minScore", cooldownSec?, oneTime? }
}

3) States, Motion & A11y

Reduce Motion: skip heavy animation; intro hero shows poster image; collage header uses a still.

Captions: required for intro video & teasers; UK English default ON.

Focus/keyboard: CTAs and first rail item focusable; visible focus rings; screen reader labels for hero CTA and collage.

4) Personalisation & Rules (unchanged engine)

visibility.stage:["before"] for Discover cards.

Featured elevation via Before Featured Rules (time→T-x, tier, geo, popularity).

Persona gates: hasTicket, tier, firstTimer, accessibilityPref, momentumScore.

5) Acceptance Criteria

Opening animation plays, then the Intro Video Hero (from CMS) appears with primary CTA; dismissal reveals the main UI.

Discover shows a collage header (from CMS) and optional featureReel; the feed contains Chapters, Teasers, At-home AR, Daily Drop only.

Tapping a Chapter Tile opens the full-screen reader; the pink logo circle returns to Discover with scroll preserved.

All assets, copy, CTAs and visibility are CMS-controlled using the existing card mechanism.

A11y (captions, focus, reduce-motion) and micro-animations behave as specified.

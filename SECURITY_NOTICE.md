# Security Notice - Media Processing Implementation

## Critical Security Issues Identified

The media processing API endpoint `/api/cms/process-media` has been **temporarily disabled** due to critical security vulnerabilities identified during code review.

### Issues Found:
1. **No Authentication**: The endpoint was publicly accessible without admin verification
2. **No Rate Limiting**: Could be abused for resource exhaustion attacks  
3. **No Input Validation**: No MIME type or file size validation
4. **Resource Intensive**: Expensive FFmpeg operations without protection
5. **Integration Problems**: Duplicated existing transcoder logic instead of using proven system

### Current Status:
- ✅ Endpoint disabled with HTTP 503 response
- ✅ User-friendly error message explaining the situation
- ✅ CMS UI updated to show appropriate message

### Next Steps Required:
1. **Add Authentication**: Integrate with existing `isAdmin` middleware
2. **Add Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse of expensive operations
3. **Use Existing Transcoder**: Integrate with `resources/transcoder` system instead of duplicating logic
4. **Fix Upload Flow**: Use proper Object Storage signed URLs instead of direct file upload
5. **Security Review**: Complete security audit before re-enabling

### Safe Alternative:
Users should continue using the existing video transcoding system:
```bash
npm run transcode  # Process videos in resources/transcoder/in/
npm run upload     # Upload to Google Cloud Storage
```

## Architecture Review Needed

The current implementation needs a complete redesign to:
- Use the existing, proven transcoder system
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Use efficient file upload mechanisms (signed URLs)
- Return proper HLS manifest URLs for playback
- Add comprehensive security controls

**This endpoint will remain disabled until these critical issues are resolved.**

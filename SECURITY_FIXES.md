# Security Fixes Implementation Report

## Critical Security Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. WebSocket Admin Authorization (FIXED ✅)

**Issue**: Any authenticated user could send admin commands (`send_cue`, `update_timecode`) to control events.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `isAdmin` field to `AuthenticatedWebSocket` interface
- Created `verifyEventAdminPermissions()` method to check:
  - User is authenticated
  - User is either a system admin OR the event creator
  - Event exists and ownership validation
- Updated `handleSendCue` and `handleUpdateTimecode` to be async and verify permissions
- Added detailed error responses and security logging

**Files Modified**:
- `server/websocket.ts` (Lines ~378-476)

### 2. QR Code Integrity Validation (FIXED ✅)

**Issue**: Client-side QR validation only checked basic format, allowing trivial spoofing.

**Fix Applied**:
- Created new secure API endpoint `/api/qr-validation`
- Implemented HMAC-SHA256 cryptographic integrity checks
- Added replay protection with timestamp and nonce validation
- Server-side event context validation
- Progress tracking to prevent duplicate collections
- Updated QR scanner to use secure server-side validation

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/api/qr-validation/route.ts` (New secure API endpoint)
- `src/components/QRScanner.tsx` (Updated to use server-side validation)

### 3. Event Ownership Controls (ENHANCED ✅)

**Issue**: Event PATCH operations only checked global admin status.

**Fix Applied**:
- Enhanced `/api/events` PATCH handler to allow event creators to manage their own events
- Added ownership verification alongside admin checks

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/api/events/route.ts` (Lines 124-133)

## Environment Variables Required

### Production Environment Setup

Add these environment variables to your production deployment:

```bash
# JWT Secret (Required in production)
JWT_SECRET=your-secure-256-bit-jwt-secret-key-here

# QR Code Cryptographic Secret (Required for QR validation)
QR_SECRET=your-secure-256-bit-qr-validation-secret-key-here
```

**Important**: 
- Use cryptographically secure random strings (256-bit minimum)
- Never commit these secrets to version control
- Rotate secrets periodically in production

## Security Architecture

### WebSocket Security Flow
1. User connects → JWT validation → Admin status cached
2. Admin command received → Permission verification → Database ownership check
3. Action allowed only if: `isAdmin=true` OR `event.createdBy=userId`

### QR Validation Security Flow
1. QR scanned → Basic format check (client-side optimization)
2. Server API call → HMAC integrity verification
3. Replay protection check (timestamp + nonce)
4. Event context validation → Database verification
5. Progress tracking → Prevent duplicate collections

### Authorization Matrix

| Action | Anonymous | User | Event Creator | Admin |
|--------|-----------|------|---------------|-------|
| Join Event | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Send Cue | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ (own events) | ✅ |
| Update Timecode | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ (own events) | ✅ |
| Validate QR | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Create Event | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Modify Event | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ (own events) | ✅ |

## Testing Checklist

- [x] WebSocket admin commands reject unauthorized users
- [x] Event creators can control their own events
- [x] QR validation requires cryptographic integrity
- [x] Replay protection prevents QR code reuse
- [x] Server-side validation cannot be bypassed
- [x] Event ownership checks are enforced
- [x] Error messages don't leak sensitive information

## Production Deployment Notes

1. Set all required environment variables
2. Use Redis or persistent storage for QR replay protection (currently in-memory)
3. Implement rate limiting on QR validation endpoint
4. Consider additional monitoring for security events
5. Regular security audits and penetration testing

## Security Monitoring

Key security events are now logged:
- Unauthorized WebSocket admin attempts
- QR integrity validation failures
- Replay attack attempts
- Event ownership violations

Monitor these logs for potential security threats.
